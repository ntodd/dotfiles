Commits have been made to the current branch since the PR was created. Figure out what has changed and update the PR
if needed to reflect the changes. If nothing major has changed or been added, there is no need to update the PR.

Try not to add new top-level sections and follow the pull request template structure in
`.github/pull_request_template.md`.
